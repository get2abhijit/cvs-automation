This project has two tools.
I am using them as a learning exercise.

1. CVS history analyzer -
   This will provide the CVS history in a commit-based structure so that individual commits can be analyzed.
   
2. CVS commit extractor -
   This extracts the file:<rev. no> part of a cvs commit log. User has to enter the log to be copied. This is simply to have a structured module revision info.
